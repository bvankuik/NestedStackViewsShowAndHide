# NestedStackViewsShowAndHide

When you hide/unhide an element in a UIStackView, it will nicely animate.
However when there's only a single element in the stackview, the animation
will go wrong. To see what happens, run the project and click the "Toggle
Visibility" button. Then tap the "Add dummy view" button and try again.
